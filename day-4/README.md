# Day 4 | Grab the Numbers

Given a string including a bunch of _characters and numbers_, return the **sum** of all the numbers in the string. Note that multiple digits **next to each other** are counted as _a whole number_ rather than separate digits.

## Examples

    grabNumberSum("aeiou250abc10") ➞ 260

    grabNumberSum("one1two2twenty20") ➞ 23

    grabNumberSum("900uwu50uwuuwuuwu25uwu25") ➞ 1000

## Notes

Remember not to just add _single digit numbers together_, it should be possible for answers to easily get into the 100s!
